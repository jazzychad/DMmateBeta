# DMmate Beta Testing

## Quickstart

### Download the files

Click the "Download source" button near the upper right of the screen. This will let you download a zip of the three files listed.

### Unzip and install the app

Unzip the file on your computer. You will then have to unzip the DMmate.app.zip file as well.

### Drag/drop to install

Drag and drop the .mobileprovision and .app files onto the iTunes icon in your dock to install onto your phone.

### Enjoy DMmate!

You should now be able to launch DMmate on your phone and enter your Twitter account info. Follow the steps below to enable real-time Push Notifications for your DMs as well.

## What is DMmate?

DMmate is an iPhone Twitter app devoted solely to Direct Messages. No timelines, no mentions, no lists, no retweets, just DMs.

## Why make DMmate?

I am a heavy user of DMs. I found that all other iPhone Twitter clients suck at DMs for various reasons. Also, none of them had adequate real-time push notifications for DMs. So, I wrote this app to cater to my DM usage pattern, and I think that many other people would want to experience DMs on their phones this way as well.

## Why do other iPhone Twitter clients suck at DMs?

* No manual refresh
* Polling only every 5 or 10 minutes
* Non real-time push notifications
* DMs are an afterthought after the rest of the Twitter features

## Why does DMmate rock at DMs?

* An app solely devoted to DMs
* Manual refresh
* Real-time updates of DMs
* Real-time push notifications
* Threaded conversation views
* Multiple accounts
* Turns Twitter DMs into an IM application

## How to use Push Notifications for DMmate

In order to have your DMs pushed straight to your phone in real-time, you need to do 2 things:

1. Make sure you have enabled notification emails for DMs under your Twitter account.
2. In your email client, create a filter and forward those emails to __prowl@push.tweetgrid.com__

That special email address will take your DM email and immediately push the DM to your phone. This means no more polling and immediate updates!
